# Trie Data Structure Implementation ðŸ“šðŸŒ³

Welcome to the **Trie Data Structure Implementation** project! This repository demonstrates how to implement a Trie (Prefix Tree) in JavaScript, which is ideal for applications such as autocomplete and spell-checking. ðŸ“–âœ¨

## ðŸ“œ Overview
A **Trie** is a tree-like data structure that efficiently stores strings, allowing for fast lookup, insertion, and prefix-based search. Each node represents a character, and paths through nodes represent words. This structure is commonly used in search engines and dictionaries.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Efficient insertion and search of words.
- Prefix-based search for autocompletion.
- Ability to retrieve word suggestions based on a prefix.
